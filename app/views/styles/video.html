<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The video team use a product called brightcove to serve video content on the NHS.UK site, so we were limited in how much we could edit the player - not able to include custom play icons etc. </p>

<p>Also, due to the way video content has been rolled out - we were unable to make sweeping changes across the site in one go. Videos will need to be updated individually. </p>
  
<p>The video team is currently in discovery for a new video player, we'll be passing our findings and working closely with the team to ensure our initial learnings are built on. </p>


<h2 id="user-needs">User needs</h2>


<ul>
  <li>As a user I WANT visual context (supporting written information), SO THAT I can help identify my health thing (condition / symptom / medicine).</li>
  <li>As a user I WANT an alternative to text, SO THAT I can seen how to do something.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Whats currently being used</h2>

<ul>

  <li>We have a mixture of educational health videos such as La Bomba dance exercise <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-fitness-studio/dance-la-bomba/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-fitness-studio/dance-la-bomba/</a></li>
  <li>and informative videos - such as Sore throat <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sore-throat/">https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sore-throat/</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Our hypothesis</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Users want to know how long the video is upfront</li>
  <li>Users don't understand review dates</li>
  <li>Users don't want overlaid text (disapears when you press play)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Research findings</h3>
<ul>
<li>3/5 users recognised the video component and were easily able to use it 
    <li>However, one user thought the video would link to another page rather than play inline </li>
    <li>Another user, who had a visual and cognitive impairment, didn’t recognise the video on the page </li>
    <li>All users commented the video was helpful</li>

  <div class="example" style="background-color: #eff2f3;">

  <div class="example-snippet">

  </div>

  <h2 id="resources">Accessibility</h2>

  <p>We made the player background black and the icons white which meets AAA WCAG standards.</p>
  
  <p>We also increased the size of the icons - so they have a larger hit area.</p> 
  <p>The title and description has moved from being overlaid the video content to beneath the player and we've introduced the duration of the video. </p>

</ul>



<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>


  <ul>
    <li>Only use video media where it adds to user understanding</li>
    <li>Don't be overly reliant on video to convey information - from an accessibility perspective, providing content as a video can limit access to the information contained in this format for anyone who cannot see or hear the content. In addition, videos break. In testing we’ve seen many a user run across a video that won’t load, doesn’t appear, can’t be played, or freezes. (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/video-usability/">https://www.nngroup.com/articles/video-usability/</a>)</li>
    <li>Video sizing - to ensure video flows with content; size 2/3 on larger screens (desktop / tablet) and full width on small screens (mobile)</li>
    <li>Title and description - do not overlay video, must sit within content.</li>
    <li>Clearly display the length of the video</li>
    <li>Be upfront with users if the video contains graphic content</li>



  </ul>
  

<h2>Going forward</h2>
<h3>What is success</h3>
<p>Success would be an increase in plays and increase in users watching the content till the end. </p>

<h3>How we measure success</h3>
<p>Success could be measured by plays and retention (users watching video content until the end).</p>

<h3>Hypotheses for design iterations</h3>

<p>We'd like to explore the use of our own icons - for constancy across the site. Having the play bar always visible (on the bright cove player it only appears when you hover the mouse). </p>

<p>Also working are on the media review dates, which have place on the page (to meet the NHS England info standard) - but don't meet any user needs. </p>
